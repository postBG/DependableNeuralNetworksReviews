We are planning to improve the proposed method further. According to the results, the proposed regularization seems too strong. We are planning to find a way to soften or stabilize the regularization. Additionally, we will conduct more experiments using other datasets like VLCS~\cite{chen2013vlcs} and other models such as ResNet~\cite{He2016resnet}.
