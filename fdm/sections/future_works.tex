We are planning to improve the proposed method further. According to the results, the proposed regularization seems too hard. Specifically, the proposed constraint prevents the model from learning more semantic features. Therefore, We are planning to find a way to soften or stabilize the regularization. Additionally, we will conduct more experiments and analysis using other datasets like VLCS~\cite{chen2013vlcs} and other models such as ResNet~\cite{He2016resnet}.
