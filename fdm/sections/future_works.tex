In \ref{resnet_discussion}, we have discussed the difference between invariant in terms of feature distributions and invariant regarding performing the task at hand. Therefore, it would be better to design a new algorithm that can achieve task-specific invariant. It could be done by considering the relationship between feature distributions and decision boundaries. Therefore, adversarial attacks could be helpful because the technique is about the relationship.
