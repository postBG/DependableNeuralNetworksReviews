%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
 Domain generalization (\textit{DG}) aims to learn a model that generalizes well to an unseen domain (\textit{target domain}), which has a different distribution than known domains (\textit{source domain}). Many of the previous works try to learn domain-invariant features. These methods adopt a loss that tries to match the whole distributions of the source domains. However, these works are sub-optimal because they rarely utilize task-specific information, such as class labels. For concerning the information, we propose a simple but effective regularizing method. The proposed method attempts to match the feature distributions of the same classes. By doing this, a model is expected to learn more task-specific and robust features than the previous works.
