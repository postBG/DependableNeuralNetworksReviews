We suggest a simple regularization technique called Class-wise Feature Distribution Matching Regularization. We conduct various experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed method consistently improves the performance of the baseline. However, further analysis reveals that the domain-invariant achieved by the regularizing technique is not critical to the performance. Moreover, through the study, we could learn the invariant in terms of distribution is less important than the invariant regarding performing the task at hand.
