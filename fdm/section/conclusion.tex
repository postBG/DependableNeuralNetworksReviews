We suggested a simple but effective regularization method called Class-wise Feature Distribution Matching Regularization. The experiments on the PACS dataset showed the proposed method can improve the performance of the baseline. Additionally, even though the FDM is sub-optimal compared to state-of-the-art, FDM is comparable or better than the majority of the previous works.
